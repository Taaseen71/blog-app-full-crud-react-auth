# Blog App Full-Stack âš¡

Your task is to build a blog using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and React

Your app should include the following:

- CRUD on the backend (an api where you can create, read, update, and delete blog posts)
- CRUD on the frontend (a react frontend that has axios calls that can create, read, update, and delete blog posts)

**Tip**

- Keep your react app simple (as close to the products app as possible)
- You can always add features later! Get it to work first.

**Deploy**
> include your deployment url in the pull request description
